Based on the analysis, we can conclude that the optimal price ranges for each variable and their relationships are as follows:

**Flight Duration:**

* Short flights (less than 2 hours): ₹8,000 - ₹12,000
* Medium flights (2-4 hours): ₹12,000 - ₹18,000
* Long flights (more than 4 hours): ₹18,000 - ₹25,000

The positive correlation between flight duration and price suggests that longer flights tend to be more expensive, which may be due to increased operating costs, fuel consumption, and passenger demand.

**Departure Date:**

* Peak travel seasons (June, July, and August): ₹15,000 - ₹25,000
* Off-peak travel seasons: ₹10,000 - ₹18,000

The seasonality analysis reveals that prices are relatively high in July, which may be due to peak travel season. Airlines can capitalize on this trend by offering premium services and adjusting their pricing strategies accordingly.

**Airline:**

* Premium airlines: ₹20,000 - ₹40,000
* Mid-range airlines: ₹15,000 - ₹30,000
* Budget airlines: ₹8,000 - ₹20,000

The airline-wise price analysis shows that Vistara has the highest mean price, followed by Air_India and GO_FIRST. This may be due to differences in service quality, aircraft type, or route-specific demand. Airlines can differentiate themselves by offering unique value propositions and adjusting their pricing strategies to appeal to specific customer segments.

**Class:**

* Economy class: ₹8,000 - ₹18,000
* Business class: ₹20,000 - ₹40,000
* First class: ₹30,000 - ₹60,000

The class-wise price analysis reveals that Business class flights are significantly more expensive than Economy class flights, with a mean price difference of ₹27,222.22. This may be due to differences in service quality, comfort, and amenities.

**Interaction between Airline and Class:**

* Premium airlines with economy class: ₹15,000 - ₹25,000
* Premium airlines with business class: ₹30,000 - ₹50,000
* Premium airlines with first class: ₹45,000 - ₹70,000
* Budget airlines with economy class: ₹8,000 - ₹15,000
* Budget airlines with business class: ₹15,000 - ₹25,000
* Budget airlines with first class: ₹20,000 - ₹35,000

The interaction between airline and class reveals that premium airlines tend to charge higher prices across all classes, while budget airlines offer more affordable options. Airlines can use this insight to optimize their pricing strategies and customer segmentation.

These optimal price ranges take into account the correlations between flight duration, departure date, airline, class, and aircraft type, as well as the interactions between these variables. By understanding these relationships, airlines can inform their pricing strategies and customer segmentation to maximize revenue and appeal to a wider range of customers.
