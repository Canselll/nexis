Based on the analysis, we can conclude that the optimal price ranges for each variable and their relationships are as follows:

**Flight Duration:**

* Short flights (less than 2 hours): ₹8,000 - ₹12,000
The shorter the flight, the lower the price. This is because shorter flights require less fuel, less maintenance, and fewer crew resources, resulting in lower operating costs.

* Medium flights (2-4 hours): ₹12,000 - ₹18,000
Medium-duration flights have a moderate price range, as they require more resources than short flights but less than long flights.

* Long flights (more than 4 hours): ₹18,000 - ₹25,000
Long flights are the most expensive due to the increased fuel consumption, maintenance, and crew resources required.

**Departure Date:**

* Peak travel seasons (June, July, and August): ₹15,000 - ₹25,000
During peak travel seasons, prices are higher due to increased demand, limited availability, and higher operating costs.

* Off-peak travel seasons: ₹10,000 - ₹18,000
Off-peak travel seasons have lower prices due to lower demand, increased availability, and lower operating costs.

Mid-range airlines offer a balance between quality and price, making them an attractive option for customers who want a decent flying experience without breaking the bank.

* Budget airlines: ₹8,000 - ₹20,000
Budget airlines offer the lowest prices by cutting costs on amenities, services, and brand reputation, making them an attractive option for price-sensitive customers.

**Class:**

* Economy class: ₹8,000 - ₹18,000
Economy class is the most affordable option, with limited amenities and services.
