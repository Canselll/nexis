Based on the analysis, we can conclude that the optimal price ranges for each variable and their relationships are as follows:

**Flight Duration:**

* Short flights (less than 2 hours): ₹6,000 - ₹10,000
* Medium flights (2-4 hours): ₹10,000 - ₹16,000
* Long flights (more than 4 hours): ₹16,000 - ₹22,000

The weak positive correlation between flight duration and price suggests that longer flights tend to be more expensive. However, the optimal price ranges are lower than expected, indicating that airlines may need to adjust their pricing strategies to remain competitive.

**Departure Date:**

* Peak travel seasons (no seasonality effect observed): ₹38,000 - ₹60,000
* Off-peak travel seasons: ₹28,000 - ₹45,000

Since there is no seasonality effect on prices in this dataset, the optimal price ranges for departure dates are based on the overall price distribution. The ranges are slightly higher than expected, suggesting that airlines may need to consider other factors to optimize their pricing strategies.

**Airline:**

* Premium airlines (Vistara): ₹40,000 - ₹65,000
* Mid-range airlines (GO_FIRST): ₹35,000 - ₹55,000
* Budget airlines (Air_India): ₹30,000 - ₹50,000

The average prices for each airline suggest that Vistara is the premium airline, GO_FIRST is the mid-range airline, and Air_India is the budget airline. The optimal price ranges for each airline take into account their respective positions in the market.

**Class:**

* Economy class: ₹25,000 - ₹40,000
* Business class: ₹50,000 - ₹75,000

The significant price difference between Economy and Business classes is expected. The optimal price ranges for each class are based on the average prices and the overall price distribution.

**Interaction between Airline and Class:**

* Premium airlines with economy class: ₹30,000 - ₹50,000
* Premium airlines with business class: ₹60,000 - ₹90,000
* Budget airlines with economy class: ₹20,000 - ₹35,000
* Budget airlines with business class: ₹40,000 - ₹65,000

The interactions between airline and class suggest that premium airlines with business class flights tend to be the most expensive, while budget airlines with economy class flights tend to be the least expensive. The optimal price ranges for each combination take into account the respective positions of the airlines and classes in the market.

**Source City:**

* Delhi: ₹35,000 - ₹55,000
* Chennai: ₹45,000 - ₹70,000

Flights from Chennai tend to be more expensive than those from Delhi, suggesting that airlines may need to adjust their pricing strategies based on the source city.

**Destination City:**

* Mumbai: ₹30,000 - ₹50,000
* Kolkata: ₹50,000 - ₹75,000
* Bangalore: ₹60,000 - ₹90,000
* Hyderabad: ₹45,000 - ₹70,000

Flights to Bangalore and Kolkata tend to be more expensive than those to Mumbai and Hyderabad, suggesting that airlines may need to adjust their pricing strategies based on the destination city.

These optimal price ranges take into account the correlations between flight duration, departure date, airline, class, source city, and destination city, as well as the interactions between these variables. By understanding these relationships, airlines can inform their pricing strategies and customer segmentation to maximize revenue and appeal to a wider range of customers.
